# Welcome to adminDash!

This project is meant to be a slow burner, and have many updates over time. Its also a template, meant for future project
to easily be able to do CRUD actions on projects.

## User Stories

- Users will be able to sign-in with an admin account.
- Users will be able to see necessary data, and do CRUD actions on some of that data.
- Users will be able to view notifications from team.
- Users will be able to chat with other team members, and get notified on new messages.
- Users will be able to set a light or dark mode.

## Planned Features

Again, this is a slow burner project. Over time, I was to add
- Chat functionality.
- Notification system.

This is also meant to change with different projects, so different projects will need different feature sets.
